### 4. My Learning from This Dashboard

Working on the **Paris Olympics 2024 Dashboard** has been an enriching experience that allowed me to enhance my skills in data visualization and analytics using Power BI. I learned how to design interactive dashboards that provide users with a clear and comprehensive view of complex datasets. Specifically, I improved my ability to:
- Use **Power BI** to create dynamic visualizations that can filter data by country, gender, and medal type.
- Interpret large datasets and present meaningful insights, such as identifying the top-performing countries and analyzing athlete demographics.
- Leverage **historical data** to reveal trends over time, offering valuable context for understanding current performance.
- Design user-friendly interfaces that make it easy for stakeholders to extract actionable insights from the data.

This project has not only deepened my understanding of data visualization but also honed my ability to deliver insights that aid decision-making in a global event like the Olympics.
